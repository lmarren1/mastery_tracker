                I'm so excited to start working on this project!
                It's been a long time coming and I've finally stopped making excuses and have gotten to work.
                I know it'll be a grind from here on out, so we'll see what my outlook is like in a month.

                I started last night (8-3), so this accounts for both today and yesterday.
                I've been working on basic HTML, CSS, and some JS for this site.
                As a non-arts major, I think I beautified the <i>hell</i> out of this.
                I feel so good starting the 10,000 hour process that I've been seen kicking my feet smiling today.
                I just feel like this could really turn things around for me and give me something to feel good about,
                regardless of its real-world outcomes.
                Feeling capable is a pretty crazy feeling.

                Today's a much busier day than yesterday, so my progress here will be limited.
                Got a lot of solid hours in yesterday, though, and I'm happy with the basic functionality of the website
                and of my data collection.
                Going forward I want to: add cool interactive graphs to the homepage,
                pull the hours/timeline of these posts from the data CSVs,
                make a script that automates the template for weekly blog posts like this,
                pull the cumulative hours from the data CSVs onto the homepage,
                make it so that the latest weekly post appears on the homepage (automate that).
                I've got some work ahead of me! I'm excited!

                Today was exceptionally busy, so I only got to put in about 20 minutes.
                The reason I started this project now rather than on the 'lock-in' date of September 1st was so that I
                could start building consistent habits prior to the actual goal-oriented timeline starting.
                Clearly, I will have to dig deeper and find more time going forward if I am to be dedicated to the
                10,000 hours.
                That being said, I'm still in a good place and am still excited and full of ideas for the future.
                Patience in the macro and eagerness in the micro are the two things I'm trying to build here early on.

                Learned python's PEP standards.
                Altered time-logger.py's structure to improve readability and streamline function.
                Implemented update_docstring.py with a .git/pre-commit hook to track file version.

            <p><span class="color"><b>Tomorrow's Goals: </span></b>
                Finalize update_docstring.py.
                Start plotly graph creator script.
            </p>
            <p><span class="color"><b>Notes: </span></b>
                I'm learning a lot about how to properly structure Python scripts according to PEP standards.
                I think before I start creating more complex scripts and series of scripts, I need to ensure readability
                and clear structure.
                I'm using Black as my Python formatter now and it's doing wonders.
                I often make the mistake of rushing into script-writing before I even know what I want the program to
                accomplish, so being really on-top of my program's structure and asserting its purpose early on is a big
                step in the right direction.
                Just a heads-up, I will be playing around with the structure of these posts somewhat to see what might
                work best for quality reflection down the road.
                I've included accomplishments and goals sections to go along with the notes.
                Hopefully this will make it clear to the reader what I've been working on instead of just how I'm
                feeling about what I'm working on.

                My commit messages are awful. 
                Reading through them is an eyesore and a headache combined.
                So, today, I'm going to write better commits, be more selective with what I choose to commit, and begin writing the plotly graph script.
